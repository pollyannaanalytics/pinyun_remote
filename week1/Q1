// Q1: Try the statements below in REPL, and answer whether they are correct or not.

a. val id = 9527
    correct: "val" is suitable when variable will not be changed, and when the variable is not assign type, kotlin will judge the type automatically according to the value.
    the value and the type are not in conflict.

b. var number: Int = 5.6
    error: The Int type should be only assigned integer value(e.g. 1, 2, 3, 0 ...)
    the value and the type are in conflict.

c. var title = "Hello Kotlin!"
    correct: when value is String type, should be add "" double quotation marks.
    the value and the type are not in conflict.

d.  val content : String = null
    error: String type is a non-null type, null cannot be a value of String.
    the value and the type are in conflict

e. val number : Double? = 556.6
    correct: Double type is to used in float(e.g. 1.2, 3.14....)
    the value and the type are not in conflict

f. var list: List<String> = listOf(null, null)
    error: listOf() is a immutable function, which can not input null. If we need to create a list which includes null, we can use mutableListOf(null, null)

g. var list: List<String?>? = listOf("Wayne", "Chen")
    correct: elements in the list are String type, so the value and the type are not in conflict

h. list.size
    error: as the g. statement, list is a variable which allows null value. In this situation, we need to use "?" to tell compiler to deal with null value.

i. list?.size
    correct: When list is added "?", compiler can deal with null value. As the result, compiler can return a valid list's size.
